# Rules

## Basic Rules

Dvorak is played entirely with cards, and there are just two types of card - Things and Actions.

 - When you play a Thing card, it goes onto the table in front of you and stays there, usually having a useful effect while it remains in play.
 - When you play an Action card, it does whatever it does and goes into to the discard pile.

## Setup

- Take the deck of cards, shuffle it, and deal five cards to each player, which they hold in their hand where other players can't see.
- The rest of the cards go in the middle of the table as a face-down draw pile, and whenever a card is discarded or destroyed, it goes into a face-up discard pile.

## Turns

Starting with a random player, you take turns in order.

A turn consists of:

- Drawing the top card from the draw pile.
  - If the draw pile's empty, shuffle the discard pile and turn it over to make a new draw pile.
- Playing up to two cards from your hand.
  - You can play one Thing and one Action per turn...
  - Or just one of those...
  - Or no cards at all!
- Checking your hand size; if you have more than five cards, discard down to five.
